Metabulo
========

Getting started
---------------

Metabulo is configured from a `.env` file present in the current directory
where it is executed.  See the included [.env_example](./.env_example) for an
example.  Once the environment is in place, you will need to initialize the
tables by running
```
metabulo-create-tables
```

Start the development server by running:
```
flask run
```
